## Team Summary 

### Introduce your company and how it will be presented to consumers. If your company is already established, please explain how the product/solution you are pitching for this challenge integrates into your current branding.
Delphi, our company, is yet to be founded but we would focus on applying our skill set in Machine Learning and Data Analysis onto various fields through key partnerships that would offer domain knowledge. Our team, in the past, has been able to accomplish this successfully through various different clients and projects that have spanned different industries. 

### Explain the ownership structure of your company and how this will change over time. Who plays a key role in your company and what plans do you have to expand or change this over time?

At the moment, Delphi consists of two individuals and we would split all things equally in terms of ownership. In terms of the key roles, Prathic’s focus is on problem space research and integrating the domain knowledge with the actual computer science strategies while Suraj’s focus is on the core strategies and models built by the team. 

### Introduce the members of your team and why they will be good founders for this company. What unique strengths do you bring to solving this challenge?

Suraj Rajendran: Suraj is doing a PhD in Computational Biology at Weill Cornell Medical College. He has experience in developing machine learning protocols and models for organizations like Wake Forest Baptist Medical Hospital and Colgate-Palmolive. At these organizations, he has built predictive diagnosis models, tools to parse medical data, and other machine learning algorithms. For these models, he has written **[manuscripts](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w8Ra_mgAAAAJ&hl=en)** that detailed the methodologies. He has a background in biomedical engineering and device development, with a thorough understanding of the product lifecycle. He's involved in the Accelerating Bioventure Innovation program at Weill Cornell where he has practice pitching and developing medical technologies.

Prathic Sundararajan: Prathic is a graduate of Georgia Institute of Technology with a Biomdeical Engineering degree. He has a unique focus that lies at the intersection between MedTech & Computer Science. He has had experience in the various sectors of the medical device industry in terms of Manufacturing, Quality and R&D ranging from smaller style start-up companies to larger companies like Edwards Lifesciences. Most recently at EW, he worked on implementing **[state of the art machine learning models](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Automatic-Diagnosis-of-Cardiac-Disease-from-and-Sundararajan-Moses/4df3bf3ec73df7f19b956e4e98c1cf7eaa620703)** into applications such as detecting cardiac arrhythmias. Additionally, he worked on implementing a proprietary data analytics system for monitoring manufacturing processes in line. Both projects were in their early stages.  

## Product Summary 

### Introduce your product and how it will be presented to consumers.
Our team recognizes the importance in not simply building ML models and pipelines but actually understanding the data being utilized. Additionally, we aim to understand how best we can utilize the data and our ML pipeline to advance the company's strategies and improve their key performance indicators. Oftentimes, this is overlooked, and resources are wasted because a lot of exploratory work is done that doesn’t lead to actionable outcomes. 

### Describe in detail the features of your product. What jobs do these features perform and what will be the experience of users? What features are unique to your product or competitive differentiators?

We will begin development on ML pipelines that our team has developed in house. The pipeline we start our work with will be purely dependent on the type of dataset received from our client in terms of the number of data points and different number of features. With this provided dataset, we will then begin fine tuning our models for specific applications into this field. Additionally, it is at this stage we will reach consensus with our client on key features and recommendations that hope to be derived from this data. As an example, we can focus on optimizing for increasing quality of the product, increasing throughput, decreasing material variability, etc. These are features that can only be decided once the dataset is available and an initial exploratory analysis is done. 

Our product will be unique for a couple main reasons. Our team is a diverse one with varied perspectives and backgrounds. This means that we have seen various different pieces of technologies and strategies thus providing a new set of ideas on this space. Secondly, we have proven our strategies and methods in the past at a national level, winning both technical data science competitions and those focused more so on a combination of data science and strategy. Thirdly, we have a clear recognition of the pitfalls that can occur in this space so we know what to look out for in terms of potential risks with a project such as this. 


## Business Summary 

### Describe your level of knowledge of the challenge landscape. What education and experiences have prepared your team to address this challenge?
We, as part of Delphi, have collaborated with many institutions in the past to create machine learning models and algorithms to aid in process workflows and data analysis. We worked with **[CarMax](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/news/bme-team-wins-carmax-analytics-showcase)** to develop models to predict customer retention and preferences based on different attributes. CarMax will use our models on their website to attract more customers. More recently, we developed **[machine learning models](https://www.crimrxiv.com/pub/n5sxfvlx/release/1)** for the Department of Justice to predict criminal recidivism. The DOJ will put our models to use in order to predict individuals who are in higher need of rehabilitation services. Over the last year, Delphi and our collaborators have pitched several technologies to well-known organizations like Georgia Institute of Technology, Mayo Clinic, and the U.S. Department of Education.

### Describe your sales and marketing strategy, including details about branding and customer service. How do you plan to find and retain customers for your product?

Because our technology will be specifically targeted towards bettering the workflows at Rockwell Automation and Sargento, we will have a highly targeted marketing strategy. Hence, we will not be public-facing. Branding and and further marketing decisions will be made in collaboration with Rockwell Automation and Sargento. 

### Describe the market that you are targeting and how your product and business fit into it. Explain how you will be funding your business. How will you use initial prize money and how will you continue to fund and grow your business after winning Reverse Pitch MKE.

As mentioned previously, we will be marketing our device to Rockwell Automation and Sargento. The initial prize money and accompanying data will be used to fine tune and hone our models to fulfill the needs of our clients. Any remaining resources will be put towards developing advanced algorithms that are able to take our clients' workflows to the next level. 

### Tell us your goals for the future of your business and what you see happening for your business in the coming years. What are you most excited about and where do you see potential risks?

Our company will continue working with our clients and developing models and algorithms to serve their needs. As our team grows, we will gain additional skillsets that can be used to answer questions that were previously unanswerable. All this will be possible through the use of shared client data. Using this data, we can develop analyses that will aid clients in marketing, workflow processes, and decision-making. However, all this rests on the assumption that our company has a steady access to processable data. But given the nature of novel technologies, which output massive amounts of data, we believe that our company is in the optimal position to aid any future clients.

### How and when do you plan to exit your business? What do you see as your role in the business after you exit?

We do not see ourselves exiting any time in the near future.
